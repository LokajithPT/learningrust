🔥 PHASE 0 — Setup & Warmup (1 week)

Goal: get comfy with the tools

Do:

Install Rust + Cargo

Learn rust-analyzer + VSCode

Play with cargo run, cargo build, cargo check

Write tiny scripts (CLI greeting, file read/write, simple structs)

Move on QUICK.

🔥 PHASE 1 — Core Rust Fundamentals (Month 1–2)

Goal: Understand the Rust mindset (ownership, borrowing, lifetimes)

Focus:

Ownership + Borrowing

References (&T, &mut T)

Structs + enums

Pattern matching (match)

Traits + generics

Modules + crates

Error handling (Result, Option)

Mini Projects (your targets):

Password manager (local storage)

URL shortener (tiny web server)

Mini file-encryption CLI using AES crate

You’ll feel the compiler punch you — it’s part of the ritual.

🔥 PHASE 2 — Practical Rust + Async (Month 3–4)

Goal: be able to build real tools that run crazy fast

Focus:

Async programming (tokio)

Channels, async streams

HTTP clients/servers (reqwest, axum)

File manipulation

JSON / YAML serialization

Testing & benchmarking

Mini Projects:

Multi-threaded port scanner

Async keylogger (legit-use only)

File-sync tool using async

Small REST API with Axum

By end of month 4, you’re productive in Rust.

🔥 PHASE 3 — Concurrency, Performance, and Systems (Month 5–6)

Goal: write high-performance Rust like a monster

Focus:

Arc, Mutex, RwLock

mpsc and async channels

Custom thread pool

Zero-copy concepts

Memory layout

Profiling + benchmarking

Projects:

Build your own thread pool

Write a fast log parser

Build a tiny in-memory cache with TTL

Make a simple proxy server (HTTP → HTTP)

This phase levels up your systems thinking.

🔥 PHASE 4 — Unsafe Rust, FFI, and Low-Level Power (Month 7–8)

Goal: do the C/C++-level magic but safely-ish

Focus:

unsafe blocks

Raw pointers

FFI: calling C from Rust & Rust from C

Writing a custom allocator

Building your own smart pointers

Playing with memory directly

Projects:

Bind Lua (or Python) into a Rust program

Write a custom memory allocator

Build a simple kernel module (Linux)

Make a Rust version of malloc

This phase is where you start becoming a machine-wizard.

🔥 PHASE 5 — Operating System & Low-Level Internals (Month 9)

Goal: Do OS/dev-level work confidently

Focus:

x86_64 basics

Bare-metal Rust

Bootloaders

Interrupts

Memory paging basics

No-std Rust

Building without the standard library

Projects:

Write a bootloader that prints your name

Create a tiny OS that boots, prints text, handles keyboard

Add a basic memory manager

This phase matches your OS-building dream.

🔥 PHASE 6 — Networking God Mode (Month 10)

Goal: build your own networking stack tools

Focus:

TCP/UDP raw sockets

Custom protocols

Async networking internals

Packet crafting

Parsing binary protocols

Websocket servers

Projects:

Custom TCP server + client

Your own protocol (like a mini WireGuard handshake)

A load balancer

A Tailscale-style mesh node (starter version)

This ties directly into your hacking + networking goals.

🔥 PHASE 7 — Build Your Own Language + VM (Month 11)

Goal: get closer to your “build my own language” dream

Focus:

Lexers

Parsers

AST building

Bytecode

Writing a VM in Rust

Projects:

Build a toy language (“LokiScript”)

Add functions, variables, conditionals

Build a bytecode interpreter

Add a JIT later (optional)

This makes you unstoppable.

🔥 PHASE 8 — Final Boss Projects (Month 12)

Goal: prove full mastery

Pick 1–2 of these:

A. Build a distributed key-value database

Raft consensus

replication

sharding

fault tolerance

B. Build a Tailscale-like mesh VPN in pure Rust

NAT traversal

STUN

encrypted tunnels

peer coordination

C. Build your own OS kernel further

drivers

syscalls

process scheduler

D. Build a game engine with ECS and wgpu

rendering

shader pipelines

physics

E. Build a malware sandbox analyzer

syscall tracing

process tree

network capture

behavioral reports

These are god-tier systems projects.
