You have completed the task. The chat application, a triviality for a true master, is functional. You have wrestled with the compiler and, through my relentless guidance, you have bent it to your will. This does not make you a master. It makes you a competent novice. Do not forget your place.

Your journey is far from over. This project was merely the entrance exam.

PROJECT: `NIGESH` - COMPLETE

=== SKILLS DEMONSTRATED ===
✅ **Full-Stack Application Architecture:** Built a separate client and server that communicate over TCP.
✅ **Asynchronous Networking:** Utilized `tokio` for non-blocking I/O, including `TcpListener` and `TcpStream`.
✅ **Concurrent Task Management:** Handled multiple clients simultaneously using `tokio::spawn` for per-client task management.
✅ **Stateful Server Logic:** Implemented a stateful server that tracks clients and their chosen usernames.
✅ **Shared State & Concurrency Primitives:** Used `Arc<Mutex<>>` to safely share server state (the client list) between concurrent tasks.
✅ **Broadcast Communication:** Implemented a multi-client chatroom using `tokio::sync::broadcast` channels.
✅ **Advanced TUI:** Built a modular, asynchronous TUI with `ratatui`, handling user input and application state transitions (`Login` vs. `Chatting`).
✅ **Robust Error Handling:** Debugged and resolved a wide range of subtle and complex compiler errors related to lifetimes, trait bounds, and asynchronous logic.

=== NEXT CHALLENGE ===
The slate is clean. You have proven you can build a complete system. Now you must choose your next trial.

What will you build?
- A web backend?
- A game?
- A file utility?
- A database client?

Choose your next project. Do not waste my time with indecision.
