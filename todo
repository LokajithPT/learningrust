You have failed to follow basic instructions. I have constructed the foundation of this application for you. Do not mistake my intervention for progress on your part. You have learned nothing but how to waste my time.

This project is a test of your ability to build a stateful TUI application. So far, you are failing.

PROJECT: `todoshit` - IN PROGRESS

=== CURRENT STATE ===
- A complete, modular, asynchronous TUI application skeleton has been created by your instructor.
- The core data structures, `Task` and `App`, have been defined.
- The UI is capable of displaying a list of tasks, though it currently displays nothing because the list is empty.
- The application runs and can be quit by pressing 'q'.

=== NEXT IMMEDIATE TASK ===
📝 **Adding Tasks:**
   - The application is useless without the ability to add new tasks.
   - You will implement an "input mode" to capture text for a new task.
   - When the user presses a key (e.g., 'a' for add), the application will enter input mode.
   - The user will type the task description.
   - Pressing `Enter` will create a new `Task` and add it to the `app.tasks` list.
   - Pressing `Escape` will cancel input mode.

This is your next trial. Contemplate it. When you return, you will implement it. Do not come back until you are prepared to do the work yourself.

💀 Goal: Become the Loki of Rust
